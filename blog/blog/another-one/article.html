  <p><em>Another one!</em></p>

  <p>This is my second blog post...ever! I'm truly very excited for this blog post, as it shows that I can create the content in one file, the meta data in another, and the wrapper html in a third.  Now that might not be as webby as having them all in one file, but it really does wonders for a DRY environment.</p>

  <p>This is my second blog post...ever! I'm truly very excited for this blog post, as it shows that I can create the content in one file, the meta data in another, and the wrapper html in a third.  Now that might not be as webby as having them all in one file, but it really does wonders for a DRY environment.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, I even have the ability to override the base html if I want.  That's right, I can specify a unique wrapping html file, perhaps with its own javascript and css included. Pretty nifty, eh?</p>

  <p>Well, that's it for today.  I was really just looking for a way to take up enough space to fill down past the aside.</p>

  <p><em>Cheers!</em></p>
