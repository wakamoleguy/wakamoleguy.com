          <p>For a few years now, the <a href="http://js1k.com/">JS1K</a> contest has been asking folks, "What can you do with just 1,024 bytes of JavaScript?"  As it turns out, people can do some really amazing things.  Just check out <a href="http://js1k.com/2010-xmas/demo/856">the winner from back in 2010</a> (Firefox seems to work best) which animates a decorated Christmas tree, or <a href="http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1555">Strange Crystals II</a>, which won in the spring of 2013.  For the current contest, title 'Here Be Dragons', I decided to try my hand at it.  What can I do with just 1K of JavaScript?  Not much.</p>

          <h3><a href="/2014/theme-and-variations-accordion/">Variations on a Vanilla Accordion List</a></h3>
          <time datetime="2014-02-16">February 16, 2014</time>
          <p>In the last post, I walked through one way to make a <a href="/2014/vanilla-accordion/">simple accordion list</a> using <a href="http://vanillawebdiet.com/">vanilla JavaScript</a>.  Today, I'll explore several ways an accordion list could be tweaked, sometimes for performance, sometimes for semantics, and sometimes just for style.  No one solution is ever perfect for everybody, so the aim here is to give you ideas for how to best fit the widget to your needs.  And if you don't need an accordion list on your web site, perhaps you can at least walk away having learned a couple questions to ask yourself when adding other fancy widgets to your site.  But enough delay...let's get to it!</p>

          <h3><a href="/2014/vanilla-accordion">A Basic Vanilla Accordion List</a></h3>
          <time datetime="2014-02-06">February 6, 2014</time>
          <p>Here lies my first contribution to the <a href="http://vanillawebdiet.com/">Vanilla Web Diet</a>.  I first coded up this accordion list several months ago as part of the <a href="https://www.getonsip.com">GetOnSIP</a> project.  No simple widget can be perfect for every use case.  In this post, I walk through a simple version of a collapsible accordion list, with customization ideas to come later.</p>

          <h3><a href="/2014/launch/">Wakamoleguy.com Launch</a></h3>
          <time datetime="2014-01-13">January 13, 2014</time>
          <p>Hi. My name is Will Mitchell, but I <a href="//github.com/wakamoleguy">often</a> <a href="//twitter.com/wakamoleguy">go</a> <a href="//facebook.com/wakamoleguy">by</a> <strong>wakamoleguy</strong>. Today marks the launch of <a href="http://www.wakamoleguy.com">wakamoleguy.com</a>, my new site. Okay, so it has been up since Saturday, but it didn't have any content on it until now.</p>
          <p>What is <a href="http://www.wakamoleguy.com">wakamoleguy.com</a>? It's my website. For the time being, that means it's my personal blog. I'll keep the subject matter pretty technical, although I won't commit to talking about any one topic.  I'll write what I know. Since I'm currently doing a lot of web development, that probably means mostly JavaScript and HTML5 posts at first.</p>
          <p>As I write and accumulate examples, I hope to host those on <a href="http://www.wakamoleguy.com">wakamoleguy.com</a> as well.  Experiments and proofs of concept may show up here, too. In the end, I hope it will become my home on the web.</p>
          <p>If you experience a delay when visiting this site, please excuse me. I am using <a href="https://www.heroku.com">free Heroku hosting</a> which takes five or ten seconds to wake up after inactivity. Anyways, thank you for putting up with it, welcome, and enjoy your stay!</p>
          <p class="signoff">Cheers!</p>
